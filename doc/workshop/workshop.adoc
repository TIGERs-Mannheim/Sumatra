= Sumatra Workshop

== Introduction

The aim of the workshop is to get acquainted with the architecture of the Sumatra KI by means of step-by-step instructions.
The instructions should be so simple that they can be done stupidly by copy 'n paste.
But you get around and can explore the code, compare other implementations, and question everything.

The content of the workshop is of course somewhat artificial.
The separation of duties between Metis, Play and Role is sometimes not kept correctly and serves only to have seen all levels.
Orient yourself in doubt of existing code.

The workshop assumes that you are working with IntelliJ. If you're using another IDE like Eclipse, you'll surely know what you're doing.
Sumatra can be built with Gradle and is therefore not necessarily bound to a particular IDE.

If you have any questions, you should contact someone who looks like he knows something.

== Task 1

In the first task, you will first familiarize yourself with the operation of Sumatra.

=== Build and Start

* Sumatra should already be checked out and opened with IntelliJ
* Select the Sumatra Dev run config top right and start Sumatra in debug mode (there is no reason not to start in debug mode)
* Make sure that moduli -> sim.xml is selected

=== Start a game using Referee Commands

* Open `Ref` View
* Press `STOP` (F3) -> The bots should all move and keep distance to the ball
* Now sent a `FORCE_START` (F4) -> let's go!

Here's a reference, which Referee Commands you can send when, but usually all you need is `HALT` (F2), `STOP` (F3), `FORCE_START` (F4):

=== Start a game using the AutoRef

* Stop the game, if not already stopped or halted (see previous section)
* Place the ball at the center with a right click
* Open `AutoReferee` view
* Select one of the following configurations:
- Active -> Rule violations are tracked and Game Commands are sent accordingly
- Passive -> Only rule violations are logged in the `Game Log` view
* Go back to `Ref` View: Send a kickoff for Blue or Yellow -> The rest is up to the AutoRef
* To see AutoRef decisions, open the `Game Log` View
* The AutoRef also has its own shape layers -> find them in the `Visualizer` menu

=== Stop a game

* Stop all bots immediately (Emergency Break):
- Press the `Stop` button in the toolbar (stop sign with text), or Esc
- Both AIs will switch to emergency mode
- Switch both AIs back to match mode in the `AI` view or press F1
* Sent a `HALT` command through the `Ref` view
- This is how a human referee would halt a real game
* Sent a `STOP` command through the `Ref` view
- The robots are still allowed to move (only slower)
- The game clock is paused and the robots are not allowed to touch the ball
- Usually used to prepare a freekick

=== Pause simulation

* In the `Simulation` View: Press the pause button (Ctrl + p)
* Navigate in the simulation forward or back via view (<<, >>) or shortcut (Ctrl + right / left)
* You can also increase the speed of the simulation via the slider (if the laptop is fast enough ;-), Sumatra is quite a nice CPU benchmark)
* The actual Simulation speed is displayed next to the target speed

=== Point'n Click

Info: All shortcuts are visible via the Visualizer menu

* Stop the game, if you have not already done so
* Select a robot in the bar on the left
* Left click somewhere in the field -> The bot goes there
* With Ctrl -> The bot looks to the ball at the target
* With Shift -> The bot shoots to the point
* With Ctrl + Shift -> The movement target sticks to the Mouse
* Right click into the field -> The ball is moved there
* With ctrl -> The ball is fired at max allowed speed
* With shift -> The ball comes to a stop at the target
* With shift + ctrl -> The ball has a target speed of 2m/s at the target
* For all with Alt: Ball will be chipped

=== Change number of bots

* Add up to 16 bots per team in the `Sim` view
* They will spawn at the edge of the field if space is available
* By default, the number of bots is automatically adjusted.
This can be disabled via the hook 'Auto'.

=== Draw different shapes

* The shape tree can be found on the right side of the Visualizer
* The two main folders are Sources and Layers
- In the sources folder different sources can be selected that will draw the sources.
This is useful if you want to isolate something, like draw the shapes only for the blue ai.
- In the layers folder all different kinds of shapes can be selected to be drawn.
Really basic things like the robots with Field/Basic/Bots, or advanced things visualizing complex decisions in our AI.

=== Recordings

* Start a game
* Record it with the Record button on the top left
* Let the game run for a while
* Then stop the recording by pressing the Record button again
* Tip: First pause the simulation to save computing resources while looking at the replay
* Open the recording via the replay menu
* A new window will open in which you can look at the game again and in detail
* Both there and directly in Sumatra you can activate shape layers in the Visualizer menu
* Navigate through the game
* Change the playback speed
* Use shortcuts (see tooltips on the buttons)

=== Start individual skills

* Open the `Skills` view, then select a bot
* On the left is the Ultra panel for manual control (try it out)
* Next to it, you can start Sumatra skills (e.g. the TouchKickSkill)
* Next to it, you can start bot skills (e.g. BotSkillSine with `0,0 2 1`)

=== Change configuration

* Open the `Cfg` View
* Select the `user` Tab
* Go to `Visualizer` -> `RobotInteractor` -> `penaltyAreaObstacle`
* Toggle the flag
* Press `Apply`
* Move a bot next to its own penalty area, then to the other side
* Depending on the flag value, the bot should go through the penalty area or drive around it
* The config is not persisted.
To persist (write to file), press Apply, then Save.

*Take your time and look around, next we are going to have hands on!*

Note: This comes from a time when this was done that way.
Today, thanks to better IDEs, it would not be necessary anymore, but we want to keep it consistent.

Hint: The code snippets in this workshop will not contain any imports.
IntelliJ will help you with that.
It will mark the class in red and if your cursor is on the problem suggest importing the class.
You can confirm the automatic fix (adding new imports) with Alt+Enter.

== Task 2 - Introduction to Roles

=== Background

> Each bot plays its role.

A role is used for high level control of single robots.

=== Implementation

Create a new class `edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.pandora.roles.workshop.WorkshopRole` in the `moduli-ai` module.
You can either navigate there by hand, but you can skip a lot of it by searching for "role" with Shift Shift and go to roughly the correct location.
Then right click on the `roles` package -> New -> Java Class -> `workshop.WorkshopRole`.
This will create a new package `workshop` and a class `WorkshopRole`.

Extend your new role from `ARole`:

[source,java]
----
public class WorkshopRole extends ARole {
}
----

IntelliJ will ask you to add a default constructor.
Accept the hint with Alt + Enter and you will get a constructor.
All roles should pass the required `type` parameter within the constructor, so let's write it like this:

[source,java]
----
public class WorkshopRole extends ARole
{
	public WorkshopRole()
	{
		super(ERole.WORKSHOP);
	}
}
----

Now, we need to add the new Enum-value to the enum class `ERole`:

[source,java]
----
enum ERole {
   // ...

   WORKSHOP(ic(WorkshopRole.class)),

   // ...
}
----

Make sure to add the comma to the end and move the `;` to an empty line again.
That way, the changes in the source code will look clearer in the review.

We would like to have the role drive to a certain target.
The target should be passed in from outside and should be updatable, so let's store the target and add a constructor and a setter:

[source,java]
----
public class WorkshopRole extends ARole
{
    @Setter
	private IVector2 target;


	public WorkshopRole()
	{
		super(ERole.WORKSHOP);
	}
}
----

As we added a new parameter to the constructor, we also need to add the parameter to the `ERole` value:

[source,java]
----
enum ERole {

    // ...

    WORKSHOP(ic(WorkshopRole.class)
        .setterParam(IVector2.class, "target", "pi*100,500", WorkshopRole::setTarget)),

    // ...

}
----

The actual logic of a role is mostly implemented in states that allow to easily switch between different behaviors.
For this simple example we only need a single state.
The state will use only the `MoveToSkill`, which is the backbone of many roles, as it is our standard way of driving a robot to a target position.
It's usually a good practice to work with only a single skill per role state, not only does it help to keep the code understandable, but we can also make use of the `RoleState<>` class.
It adds a lot of nice stuff to the very simple `AState` baseclass, that might come in handy for more complex state machines.
One of this nice things is, that as soon as we enter a `RoleState<>` it will automatically set the BotSkill correctly.

[source,java]
----
private class WorkshopState extends RoleState<MoveToSkill>
{
    WorkshopState()
    {
        super(MoveToSkill::new);
    }
}
----

Set this as the initial state for the role in the constructor, so that it is actually used:

[source,java]
----
class WorkshopRole
{
    // ...
    public WorkshopRole()
    {
        super(ERole.WORKSHOP);
        setInitialState(new WorkshopState());
    }
    // ...
}
----

Now let's fill our new state with some actual logic.
As mentioned, we will use the standard `MoveToSkill`.
Creation and initialization is done automatically, and we only have to update robot destination continuously based on our `target`.
We also add some initialization code, when entering the state the current position of the robot will be taken and set as the target position.
This ensures the validity of the target position, as now it never can be null.

[source,java]
----
private class WorkshopState extends RoleState<MoveToSkill>
{
    WorkshopState()
    {
        super(MoveToSkill::new);
    }


    @Override
    protected void onInit()
    {
		 if (target == null) {
             target = getPos();
         }
    }


    @Override
    protected void onUpdate()
    {
        // Update the robot destination in the skill with our target (which may got updated by the Setter)
        skill.updateDestination(target);
        // Let the bot look at the opponents goal center
        // The `Geometry` class is a singleton accessor to the currently active field dimensions.
        // Avoid storing any values from it, as they can always change.
        skill.updateLookAtTarget(Geometry.getGoalTheir().getCenter());
    }
}
----

That's it!
Next, you will test your work.

=== Test

* Start Sumatra as described in the first chapter
* Open the `AI` view
* Choose the YELLOW or BLUE AI tab
* Switch to `TEST_MODE`
* Switch to the `Roles` tab
* Choose the new `WORKSHOP` role
* Choose an ID that is present on the field (0 by default)
* Click `Create`
* The role should move to the specified position
* Change the target and bot id and create another role
* That way, you could assign a role to each bot on the field

== Task 3 - Introduction to Metis

=== Background

The Metis module is responsible for calculating all the information that are independent of roles.
It consists of many many calculator classes each with its own task, like the `BallContactCalculator` that determines all the robots currently touching the ball.
Some of the results are reused within Metis, while other are forwarded to later stages of the AI, the plays and roles.
The output of Metis stored in the class `TacticalField` which can be read, but not written to, from plays and roles.

=== Implementation

Create a new class `edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.metis.workshop.WorkshopResult` to store the target that we will calculate:

[source,java]
----
@Data
@Builder
public class WorkshopResult
{
	private IVector2 targetPos;
}
----

Add a new field to the `TacticalField`:

[source,java]
----
class TacticalField {
   // ...
   WorkshopResult workshopResult;
   // ...
}
----

We will also need a new shape layer where we can draw our own shapes.
Add

[source,java]
----
class EAiShapesLayer {
   // ...
    public static final IShapeLayerIdentifier TEST_WORKSHOP = F.create(F.layer("Workshop").category("Test"));

   // ...
}
----

to `EAiShapesLayer`.
This will add a new shape layer into the 'Test' menu called 'Workshop'.

Now we are ready to implement our new calculator.
Create a new class `edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.metis.workshop.WorkshopCalc` in `moduli-ai`, let it extend from `ACalculator` and implement `doCalc`:
The following code snippet will already contain an implementation.
Try to guess what it will do.
You can play around with it later:

[source,java]
----
package edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.metis.workshop;

import edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.metis.ACalculator;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.metis.EAiShapesLayer;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.drawable.DrawableCircle;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.drawable.IDrawableShape;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.ids.BotID;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.math.circle.Circle;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.math.line.IHalfLine;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.math.line.ILine;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.math.line.ILineSegment;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.math.line.Lines;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.math.vector.IVector2;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.wp.data.ITrackedBot;
import lombok.Getter;

import java.awt.Color;
import java.util.List;


@Getter
public class WorkshopCalc extends ACalculator
{
	private WorkshopResult workshopResult;

	@Override
	protected void doCalc()
	{
		BotID firstBotId = BotID.createBotId(1, getAiFrame().getTeamColor().opposite());
		BotID secondBotId = BotID.createBotId(2, getAiFrame().getTeamColor().opposite());

		ITrackedBot firstBot = getWFrame().getOpponentBot(firstBotId);
		ITrackedBot secondBot = getWFrame().getOpponentBot(secondBotId);

		if (firstBot == null || secondBot == null)
		{
			// Robots are missing
			return;
		}

		ILineSegment line = Lines.segmentFromPoints(firstBot.getPos(), secondBot.getPos());
		IVector2 target = line.getPathStart().addNew(line.directionVector().multiplyNew(0.5));
		workshopResult = WorkshopResult.builder()
				.targetPos(target)
				.build();

		List<IDrawableShape> shapes = getShapes(EAiShapesLayer.TEST_WORKSHOP);
		DrawableCircle dCircle = new DrawableCircle(Circle.createCircle(target, 100), Color.RED);
		dCircle.setStrokeWidth(30);
		shapes.add(dCircle);
	}
}
----

The last thing that we have to do is to register the new calculator.
Add the following lines to the `Metis` class constructor.
The calculators are run in the order they are registered, this will be important if your calculator relies on results of a previous calculator.

[source,java]
----
class Metis {
   public Metis()
   {
       // ...

       var workshopCalc = register(new WorkshopCalc());
       connect(TacticalFieldBuilder::workshopResult, workshopCalc::getWorkshopResult);

       // ...
   }
}
----


=== Testing

* Restart Sumatra
* Move Yellow robots 1 und 2 somewhere on the field
* Activate the new shape layer through the Visualizer shape tree (Test -> Workshop)
* You should see a red circle between the two robots

If you like, you can play around with the code in the calculator.
Pro-tip: Edit some code without adding new fields or methods.
Then rebuild with the hammer icon.
If you run Sumatra in Debug, IntelliJ will ask if it should reload the code.
Confirm, and your changes will most likely be applied without restarting Sumatra.
Saves a lot of time!

== Task 4 - Introduction to Plays

=== Background

Plays are used to coordinate a set of roles.
The input to a play is a set of bot ids that can be assigned to roles.

=== Implementation

Create a new play `edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.pandora.plays.workshop.WorkshopPlay`:

[source,java]
----
package edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.pandora.plays.workshop;

import edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.metis.workshop.WorkshopResult;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.pandora.plays.APlay;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.pandora.plays.EPlay;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.pandora.roles.ARole;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.ai.pandora.roles.workshop.WorkshopRole;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.math.vector.IVector2;
import edu.tigers.sumatra.math.vector.Vector2;


public class WorkshopPlay extends APlay
{
	public WorkshopPlay()
	{
		super(EPlay.WORKSHOP);
	}


	@Override
	public void doUpdateBeforeRoles()
	{
		WorkshopResult result = getAiFrame().getTacticalField().getWorkshopResult();
		if (result == null)
		{
			// Calculator result is not available
			return;
		}
		IVector2 target = result.getTargetPos();

		int numRoles = getRoles().size();
		if (numRoles == 0)
		{
			return;
		}
		IVector2 direction = Vector2.fromX(1);
		IVector2 start = target.subtractNew(direction.multiplyNew(100.0 * (numRoles - 1)));
		int i = 0;
		for (ARole role : getRoles())
		{
			WorkshopRole wsRole = (WorkshopRole) role;
			wsRole.setTarget(start.addNew(direction.multiplyNew(200.0 * i)));
			i++;
		}
	}


	@Override
	protected ARole onAddRole()
	{
		return new WorkshopRole();
	}
}
----

And add it to the existing class `EPlay`:

[source,java]
----
enum EPlay
{
   // ...
   WORKSHOP(ic(WorkshopPlay.class)),
   // ...
}
----

=== Testing

* Start Sumatra again
* Prepare the robots like in the last task
* Select the Yellow AI in the `Ai` view
* Switch it to `OFF` (remember to switch it back on after the workshop)
* Select the Blue AI
* Switch it to `TEST_MODE`
* Select the `WORKSHOP` play from the drop down menu and press create
* Select the robots that you want to assign (using shift/ctrl) and press assign
* Blue robots should align themselves between the yellow ones

Done!
Play around with the code to get more familiar with what is happening.

== Task 5 - Get creative!

You now have a basic knowledge of the AI structure.
To become more familiar, become creative.
Suggestions:

* Changes the Metis calculation
- Use different methods from common-math: vectors, lines, circles, etc ...
- Add more data to the `WorkshopResult`, like a direction for aligning the robots
* Arrange the roles such that they will use the shortest cumulative way (Tip: There is already an implementation in `APlay`)
* Add a new state to the role
- When goal is reached, then let the bot rotate in place (Tip: `TimestampTimer`)
- You could create a new skill here!
(See ASkill)

== Test Workshop result on the field

Does everything work in the simulation?
Well, then nothing can go wrong in the field right?
:) Well, let's see.
Off to the field!
