1.1.2 - 20130130
================

Client library:
- Fix tls_cert_reqs not being set to SSL_VERIFY_PEER by default. This meant
  that clients were not verifying the server certificate when connecting over
  TLS. This affects the C, C++ and Python libraries.

1.1.1 - 20130116
================

Broker:
- Fix crash on reload if using acl patterns.

Client library:
- Fix static C++ functions not being exported on Windows. Fixes bug #1098256.

1.1 - 20121219
==============

Broker:

- Add $SYS/broker/clients/expired
- Replace $SYS/broker/+/per second/+ with moving average versions published at
  $SYS/broker/load/#
- Add $SYS/broker/load/sockets/+ and $SYS/broker/load/connections/+
- Documentation on password file format has been fixed.
- Disable SSL compression. This reduces memory usage significantly and removes
  the possibility of CRIME type attacks.
- Enable SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS mode to reduce SSL memory usage further.
- Add allow_duplicate_messages option.
- ACL files can now have comment lines with # as the first character.
- Display message on startup about which config is being loaded.

  string for ease of use.

Client library:
- Free memory used by OpenSSL in mosquitto_lib_cleanup() where possible.
- Change WebSocket subprotocol name to mqttv3.1 to make future changes easier
  and for compatibility with other implementations.
- mosquitto_loop_read() and mosquitto_loop_write() now handle errors
  themselves rather than having mosquitto_loop() handle their errors. This
  makes using them in a separate event loop more straightforward.
- Add mosquitto_loop_forever() / loop_forever() function call to make simple
  clients easier.
- Disable SSL compression. This reduces memory usage significantly and removes
  the possibility of CRIME type attacks.
- Enable SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS mode to reduce SSL memory usage further.
- mosquitto_tls_set() will now return an error or raise an exception
  immediately if the CA certificate or client certificate/key cannot be
  accessed.
- Fix potential memory leaks on connection failures.
- Don't produce return error from mosquitto_loop() if a system call is
  interrupted. This prevents disconnects/reconnects in threaded mode and
  simplifies non-threaded client handling.
- Ignore SIGPIPE to prevent unnecessary client quits in threaded mode.
- Fix document error for mosquitto_message_retry_set().
- Fix mosquitto_topic_matches_sub() for subscriptions with + as the final
  character. Fixes bug #1085797.
- Rename all "obj" parameters to "userdata" for consistency with other
  libraries.
- Reset errno before network read/write to ensure EAGAIN isn't mistakenly
  returned.
- The message queue length is now tracked and used to determine the maximum
  number of packets to process at once. This removes the need for the
  max_packets parameter which is now unused.

  hashed versions.

1.0.5 - 20121103
================

Broker:
- Fix crash when the broker has use_identity_as_username set to true but a
  client connects without a certificate.
- mosquitto_passwd should only be installed if WITH_TLS=yes.

Library:
- Use symbolic errno values rather than numbers in Python module to avoid
  cross platform issues (incorrect errno on Mac OS).

Other:
- Build script fixes for FreeBSD.

1.0.4 - 20121017
================

Broker:
- Deal with poll() POLLIN/POLLOUT before POLL[RD]HUP to correctly handle the
  case where a client sends data and immediately closes its socket.

Library:

1.0.2 - 20120919
================

Broker:
- If the broker was configured for persistence, a durable client had a
  subscription to topics in $SYS/# and had messages in its queue when the
  broker restarted, then the persistent database would have messages missing
  and so the broker would not restart properly. This has been fixed.

Library:
- Fix threading problem on some systems.

Tests:
- Close socket after 08-ssl-connect-no-auth-wrong-ca.py test to prevent
  subsequent tests having problems.

- Significant improvement to memory handling on Windows.
- Bridges with outgoing topics will now set the retain flag correctly so that
  messages will be retained on the remote broker.
- Incoming bridge connections are now detected by checking if bit 8 of the
  protocol version number is set. This requires support from the remote broker.

  Linux. This has been fixed.
- Don't save $SYS messages to the on-disk persistent db. All $SYS messages
  should be reconstructed on a restart. This means bridge connection
  notifications will now be correct on a restart.

  clients to decide what to do with log messages.
- Client will now disconnect itself from the broker if it doesn't receive a
  PINGRESP in the keepalive period after sending a PINGREQ.
- Client will now send a PINGREQ if it has not received a message from the
  broker in keepalive seconds.
- mosquitto_new() will now generate a random client id if the id parameter is

- Added max_packets to mosquitto_loop(), mosquitto_loop_read() and
  mosquitto_loop_write() to control the maximum number of packets that are
  handled per call.
- Payload parameters are now void * instead of uint8_t *.
- The clean_session parameter has been moved from mosquitto_connect() to
  mosquitto_new() because it is a client parameter rather than a connection
  parameter.

  be reimplemented in a custom format. Optional support for importing old
  sqlite databases is provided.
- Added IPv6 support for mosquitto and the clients.
- Provide username and password support for the clients and client libraries.
  This is part of the new MQTT v3.1 spec.
- The broker supports the username and password connection flags, but will not
  do anything with the username and password.
- Python callback functions now optionally take an extra argument which will
  return the user object passed to the Mosquitto() constructor, or the calling
  python object itself if nothing was given to Mosquitto().
- Remove the mosquitto command line option "-i interface".
- Remove the mosquitto.conf "interface" variable.
- Add support for the listener config variable (replaces the interface
  variable)
- Add support for the bind_address config variable.
- Change the port config variable behaviour to match that of rsmb (applies to
  the default listener only, can be given just once).
- Fix QoS 2 protocol compliance - stop sending duplicate messages and handle
  timeouts correctly. Fixes bug #598290.
- Set retain flag correctly for outgoing messages. It should only be set for
  messages sent in response to a subscribe command (ie. stale data).
- Fix bug in returning correct CONNACK result to on_connect client callback.
- Don't send client will if it is disconnected for exceeding its keepalive
  timer.
- Fix client library unsubscribe function incorrectly sending a SUBSCRIBE

  parameters now apply only to QoS 1 and 2 messages and are used regardless of
  the client connection state.
- mosquitto.conf now installed to /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf instead of
  /etc/mosquitto.conf. The /etc/mosquitto/ directory will be used for password
  and access control files in the future.
- Give the compile time option of using 32-bit integers for the database IDs
  instead of 64-bit integers. This is useful where htobe64()/be64toh() are not
  available or for embedded systems for example.
- The DUP bit is now set correctly when resending PUBREL messages.
- A port to Windows native has been partially completed. This currently drops a
  number of features, including the ability to change configuration parameters
  and persistent storage.

0.8.3 - 20101004

  a /. For example, /topic/path is different to topic/path. This matches the
  behaviour of rsmb.
- Correctly calculate the will QoS on a new client connection (bug #597451).
- Add "addresses" configuration file variable as an alias of "address", for
  better rsmb compatibility.
- Bridge clean_session setting is now false, to give more sensible behaviour
  and be more compatible with rsmb.

================

- Fix DB auto upgrade for messages table.

0.6 - 20100505
==============

- Basic support for connecting multiple MQTT brokers together (bridging).
- mosquitto_sub can now subscribe to multiple topics (limited to a global QoS).
- mosquitto_pub can now send a file as a message.
- mosquitto_pub can now read all of stdin and send it as a message.
- mosquitto_pub can now read stdin and send each line as a message.
- mosquitto will now correctly run VACUUM on the persistent database on exit.
- Implement a more efficient database design, so that only one copy of each
  message is held in the database, rather than one per subscribed client.
- Add the store_cleanup_interval config option for dealing with the internal
  message store.
- Add support for disabling "clean session" for the sub client.
- Add support for automatic upgrading of the mosquitto DB from v1 to v2.
- Add persistence_file config option to allow changing the filename of the
  persistence database. This allows multiple mosquitto DBs to be stored in the
  same location whilst keeping persistence_location compatible with rsmb.
- Don't store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients. Fixes bug #572608. This
  wasn't correctly fixed in version 0.5.
- Don't disconnect clients if they send a PUBLISH with zero length payload
  (bug #573610).
- If a retained message is received with a zero length payload, the retained
  message for that topic is deleted.
- Send through zero length messages.
- Produce a warning on unsupported rsmb options instead of quitting.
- Describe clean session flag in the mqtt man page.
- Implement the max_inflight_messages and max_queued_messages features in the
  broker.

0.5.4 - 20100311
================

- Fix memory allocation in mqtt3_fix_sub_topic() (bug #531861).
- Remove accidental limit of 100 client connections.
- Fix mosquitto_pub handling of messages with QoS>0 (bug #537061).

0.5.3 - 20100303
================

- Will messages are now only sent when a client disconnects unexpectedly.
- Fix all incoming topics/subscriptions that start with a / or contain
  multiple / in a row (//).
- Do actually disconnect client when it sends an empty subscription/topic string.
- Add missing $SYS/broker/clients/total to man page.

0.5.2 - 20100302
================

- Always update last backup time, so that the backup doesn't run every time
  through the main loop once autosave_interval has been reached.
- Report $SYS/broker/uptime in the same format as rsmb.
- Make mandatory options obvious in usage output and man page of mosquitto_pub.
  Fixes bug #529990.
- Treat subscriptions with a trailing slash correctly. This should fix bugs
  #530369 and #530099.
  
0.5.1 - 20100227
================

- Must daemonise before pid file is written.

0.5 - 20100227
==============

- No longer store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients that do not have
  clean start set.
- Rename msg_timeout option to retry_interval for better rsmb compatibility.
- Change persistence behaviour. The database is now stored in memory even if
  persistence is enabled. It is written to disk when mosquitto exits and also at
  periodic intervals as defined by the new autosave_interval option.
- The writing of the persistence database may be forced by sending mosquitto
  the SIGUSR1 signal.
- Clients that do not send CONNECT as their first command are now
  disconnected.
- Boolean configuration values may now be specified with true/false as well as
  1/0.
- Log message on CONNECT with invalid protocol or protocol version.
- Default sqlite3-pcre path on Linux is now /usr/lib/sqlite3/pcre.so to match
  future sqlite3-pcre packages.
- Add mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_pub, simple clients for subscribe/publish.
- Add man pages for clients.
- Add general man page on mqtt.
- Root privileges are now dropped only after attempting to write a pid file
  (if configured). This means that the pid file can be written to /var/run/
  directly and should fix bug #523183.

0.4.2 - 20100203
================

- Fix segfault on client connect with invalid protocol name/version.

0.4.1 - 20100112
===============

- Fix regex used for finding retained messages to send on new subscription.

0.4 - 20100105
==============

- Added support for wildcard subscriptions using + and #.
- All network operations are now non-blocking and can cope with partial
  packets, meaning that networking should be a lot more reliable.
- Total messsages/bytes sent/received are now available in $SYS.
- Improved logging information - use client ip address and id instead of
  socket number.
- Broker build timestamp is available in $SYS.
- Keepalive==0 is now correctly treated as "never disconnect".
- Fixed manpage installation.
- Fixed incorrect $SYS hierarchy locations in documentation and code.
- Debug type log messages are no longer sent to "topics".
- Default logging destination no longer includes "topics" to prevent possible
  error logging to the db before it is initialised.
- Periodic $SYS messages can now be disabled.
- stdout and stderr are flushed when logging to them to give more timely
  updates.
- dup is now set correctly when resending messages.
- Database format bumped due to topic column naming fix.

0.3 - 20091217
==============

- The port option in the configuration file and --port command line argument
  may now be given any number of times to make mosquitto listen on multiple
  sockets.
- Add new config file and command line option "interface" to specify an
  interface to listen on, rather than all interfaces.
- Added host access control through tcp-wrappers support.
- Set SO_REUSEADDR on the listening socket so restart is much quicker.
- Added support for tracking current heap memory usage - this is published on
  the topic "$SYS/broker/heap/current size"
- Added code for logging to stderr, stdout, syslog and topics. 
- Added logging to numerous places - still plenty of scope for more.

0.2 - 20091204
==============

- Replaced the command line option --foreground with --daemon, swapping the
  default behaviour.
- Added the command line option --config-file, to specify a config file to
  load.  If this is not given, no config file is load and the default options
  are used.
- Added the command line option --port for specifying the port to listen on.
  This overrides values in the config file.
- Don't use persistence by default.
- Default behaviour is now more sane when run by a normal user with no command
  line options (combination of above changes).
- Added option user to config file, defaulting to a value of mosquitto. If
  this value isn't blank and mosquitto is started by root, then it will drop
  privileges by changing to the user and its primary group. This replaces the
  current behaviour of refusing to start if run by root.
- Fix non-persistent mode, which would never work in the previous release.
- Added information on default values of msg_timeout and sys_interval to the
  mosquitto.conf man page. (closes bug #492045).
